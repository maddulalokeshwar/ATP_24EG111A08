Week 3 — MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT Authentication & Protected APIs
Dates: 05 Mar 2026 – 07 Mar 2026 | Roll No: 24EG110A24

Overview
Week 3 builds a full backend with MongoDB + Mongoose, password hashing with bcryptjs, JWT-based authentication stored in HTTP-only cookies, and protected CRUD routes for both Users and Products. The same Backend-2 project is progressively refined across Days 6, 7, and 8.

Days 6, 7 & 8 — 05–07 Mar 2026
The Backend-2 project is identical across all three days, representing iterative development and in-class refinement of the same codebase.

Tech Stack
Node.js + Express.js
MongoDB + Mongoose
bcryptjs (password hashing)
jsonwebtoken (JWT)
cookie-parser (HTTP-only cookie storage)
dotenv (environment config)

Data Models
User Schema (UserModel.js)

{
  username: String  (required, minLength: 4, maxLength: 6),
  password: String  (required, hashed with bcryptjs),
  email:    String  (required, unique),
  age:      Number,
  cart: [{
    product: ObjectId (ref: 'product'),
    count:   Number   (default: 1)
  }]
}
Product Schema (ProductModel.js)

{
  productId:   Number (required),
  productName: String (required),
  price:       Number (required, min: 10000, max: 50000),
  brand:       String (required)
}
Authentication Flow
Register → POST /user-api/users — password is hashed with bcryptjs before saving
Login → POST /user-api/auth — password compared with bcryptjs.compare, JWT signed and stored as HTTP-only cookie
Protected routes → verifyToken middleware reads req.cookies.token, verifies JWT, attaches decoded payload to req.user

PUT	/user-api/users/:id	Update user by ID	Protected
DELETE	/user-api/users/:id	Delete user by ID	Protected
PUT	/user-api/cart/product-id/:pid	Add product to cart (increment if exists)	Protected
Product API (/product-api)

Method	Endpoint	Description	Auth

How to Run
cd "Day-6(05-03-2026)/Backend-2"   # or Day-7 / Day-8 — same code
npm install
node server.js
Create a .env file in the project root:

DB_URL=<your MongoDB connection string>
PORT=4000
SECRET_KEY=<your JWT secret>
Use req.http with the VS Code REST Client extension to test all routes.
